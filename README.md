This Java code represents a simplified version of the popular television quiz show "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (KBC), where contestants answer multiple-choice questions to win increasing amounts of money. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

1. **Main Class (Main):**
   - This class contains the main method where the program execution starts.
   - It initializes the game, displays the money tree, explains the lifelines available, and starts the game by instantiating objects of the Display and Ques classes.

2. **Display Class:**
   - This class is responsible for displaying the questions to the user. It calls methods from the Database interface to display each question.

3. **Database Abstract Class:**
   - This abstract class defines methods for displaying questions. Each method corresponds to a question in the game.
   - It also contains a method to prompt the user if they want to continue the game after each question.

4. **Ques Class:**
   - This class extends the Database class and implements methods to display each question.
   - It includes functionality for users to answer questions, check if the answer is correct, and use lifelines if needed.
   - Lifelines available are "Audience Poll," "50-50," and "Skip the Question."

5. **Life Class:**
   - This class provides implementations for the lifelines available in the game.
   - It includes methods for Audience Poll, 50-50, and Skip the Question lifelines.

6. **Audience Poll:**
   - Simulates the audience's response by generating random percentages for each option and displaying them to the user.

7. **50-50:**
   - Removes two incorrect options, leaving the user with two options to choose from.

8. **Skip the Question:**
   - Allows the user to skip a question, but only if they haven't reached a certain stage in the game.

The code structure is modular, with separate classes for different aspects of the game such as displaying questions, managing lifelines, and handling user interactions. It follows object-oriented principles and encapsulation to organize the code effectively. Additionally, it provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with the game.
